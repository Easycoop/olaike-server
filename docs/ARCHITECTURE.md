## Introduction

This document outlines the architecture of the application, covering key components and the overall system design to guide developers in understanding the application's infrastructure and operations.

## System Overview

The application is a full-stack solution utilizing modern web technologies to provide a scalable, reliable, and secure platform. It is composed of multiple microservices that interact to deliver the core functionalities.

## Architecture Components

### Backend

The backend is powered by **Node.js** with **Express.js** and follows a RESTful API architecture. It manages business logic, processes client requests, and interfaces with the database.

### Database

We use **PostgreSQL** as our primary relational database. Data storage, querying, and transactions are handled efficiently to ensure data integrity and performance.

### APIs

All communication between the frontend and backend happens through REST APIs. We also integrate with external services via APIs, including payment gateways and third-party authentication services.

### Authentication & Authorization

Authentication is handled using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. Authorization is role-based, and permissions are managed at the user level to ensure data access control.

### Messaging System

A real-time messaging system is implemented using **Socket.io**, enabling communication between users in the application, especially in chat rooms and support tickets.

### Notification Service

Notifications are handled using an event-driven architecture that allows for real-time updates and alerts sent to users, such as payment confirmations or support ticket updates.

### Payment Gateway Integration

We support multiple payment gateways (e.g., **Paystack**) integrated via secure APIs for handling transactions.

### KYC Module

The Know Your Customer (KYC) module is integrated to verify users' identities and ensure compliance with financial regulations.

### Roles and Permissions

Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented using custom logic to manage user roles and permissions. Admins, moderators, and regular users have different access levels to various parts of the system.

## Deployment

The application is deployed using **Docker** containers on **AWS EC2** instances, ensuring scalability and environment consistency. CI/CD pipelines are set up for smooth deployment and updates.

## Monitoring and Logging

We use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring system health and performance metrics. Logs are stored using **ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for debugging and tracking errors.

## Scaling

Auto-scaling policies are in place to handle increased traffic, especially during peak times. The system can horizontally scale by adding more server instances to balance the load.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues include server downtime, API failures, and database connection errors. Refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for detailed steps on resolving these.

## FAQ
